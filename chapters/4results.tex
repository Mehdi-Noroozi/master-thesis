Out of 95 respondents, 87 percent were male (n = 83), and 13 percent female (n = 12) with a mean age of 32 years old (n = 95). Percentage of the respondents who reported that they were working in team was 96 (n = 91), and the proportion of people working in co-located teams (n = 46, 48\%) were slightly less than those who reported working in distributed teams (n = 49, 52\%).
